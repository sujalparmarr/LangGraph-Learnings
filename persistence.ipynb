       " 'explanation': 'Here’s why the joke lands:\\n\\n- Structure: It’s a setup-punchline joke. The setup asks about a promotion, which makes you think of a workplace win or ladder-climbing. The punchline flips that expectation.\\n\\n- The key pun: “outstanding” has two meanings:\\n  - Literally: “standing out” or “standing in a field.”\\n  - Figuratively: “exceptionally good” or “excellent.”\\n\\n- The word “field”:  \\n  - In the literal sense, a field is where crops grow. Potatoes (which turn into fries) are grown in fields.  \\n  - In the figurative sense, “in your field” means in your area of expertise.\\n\\n- The joke ties these together: a fry (a potato-based food) gets promoted because it’s “outstanding in its field.” It plays on being excellent in its domain while also literally being in a field (the field where potatoes grow). The humor comes from the double meaning and the silly image of a snack being promoted like an employee.\\n\\n- Extra angle: It’s also a play on a classic pun used in similar jokes, e.g., “Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field.” The structure relies on the same double-meaning wordplay.\\n\\nIf you want to explain it to kids, you might highlight:\\n- “Outstanding” = really great, or literally standing out.\\n- “Field” = the place where crops grow, like potatoes used to make fries.'}"
