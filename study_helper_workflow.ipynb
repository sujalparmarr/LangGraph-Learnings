Prices are determined by supply and demand and are influenced by company performance, economic conditions, and investor sentiment. It is organized around stock exchanges (like the NYSE and NASDAQ) and over-the-counter markets, and is regulated by government authorities with the help of brokers, clearinghouses, and other participants.\n"

      "\n",
      "- Farmers‚Äô market of ownership\n",
      "  - Each share is a tiny slice of a company. The price moves up or down based on how many people want to buy versus sell, driven by what they think the company will earn in the future. If the company pays dividends, that‚Äôs like getting a share of the profits along the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Auction house\n",
      "  - Stocks trade like items in an auction. Buyers place bids, sellers set asking prices, and the market price is where the highest bids meet the lowest asks. New information can shift bids and change prices quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Owning a franchise or sports team\n",
      "  - Investors own a stake in a business‚Äôs future profits. If the company performs well and grows, the value of the stake rises. Poor performance or bad news can lower the price you could sell it for.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Weather forecast of risk\n",
      "  - The stock price reflects the market‚Äôs view of risk and future outcomes. As new information arrives (earnings, news, world events), the ‚Äúforecast‚Äù updates and prices adjust.\n",
